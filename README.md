This is the repository for paper `Learning Task-Aware Effective Brain Connectivity for fMRI Analysis with Graph Neural Networks'. 

The code will be published upon the acceptance of this paper. Thanks for your patience!

We provide the previous review (3 accept and 1 weak reject but still not accepted) for this paper in the `/review` folder. Feel free to check it.

If you really need the code for your research, then feel free to email to `yueyu@gatech.edu` for the implementation (However, the code is not cleaned up).
