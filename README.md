This is the repository for paper `Deep Dag Learning of Effective Brain Connectivity for FMRI Analysis' (ISBI 2023). 


# Run the code
Go to `benchmark` folder, use `benchmark_golem_abcd.py` and `benchmark_golem_pnc.py` for ABCD and PNC datasets, respectively.

Note: You need to pretrain using the pearson correlation first, then finetune on the generated DAGs.
